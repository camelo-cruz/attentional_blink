Welcome to our experiment!


On each trial you will see a number of adjectives in rapid serial presentation. Two of the adjectives, adjectives of color names, are the "targets", which you are to report at the end of the trial.

Your task is to (1) report the color of the first color word, and (2) report the color of the second color word.


You can start each trials with a press of the space bar.
