Welcome to our experiment!


On each trial you will see a number of adjectives in rapid serial presentation. Two of the adjectives are the "targets", which you are to report at the end of the trial.

Your task is to (1) report the first color adjective, and (2) report the second color adjective.

You can start each trials with a press of the space bar.
